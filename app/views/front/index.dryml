    Here is where Toy Office comes in.
    <li>   
      In your toy office, you can construct and then manage the different areas of
      your life as you would an office built with an erector set. Add a building
      block for my job search, another for Mom's 80th Birthday, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      So, how do you build something meaningful, whether it's as simple as a
      recipe or as complex as ? Simply connect the blocks together, into lists,
      tables, columns, rows, forms, web pages. What would to take a geek a week
      is now easy for anyone in seconds. That is the Toy Office breakthrough!
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul param="sub-title" class="purple">Toy Office 101
    <li>
      Start by clicking the All button for an list of any publicly available
      offices. If you are signed in you can even make your own toy office on the
      web: just click on Add my own toy office. It will appear as card #something. Click on
      it, change its name and choose the list view. It's the easiest. The list
      view lets you add items. You can add items to anything, even other items.
      You can get 80% of the benefit with just the list view and it only takes
      minutes to learn. You get a instant web site, a place to share info and
      pick up comments, a common ground to work together on stuff, a place to
      post your resum√© for higher visibility. And your own office in the toy
      office cloud building. With your own web address like toyoffice.net/suite/9003 (coming soon).
