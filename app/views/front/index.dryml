    Here is where Toy Office comes in.
    <li>   
      In your toy office suite, you can construct and then manage the different
      areas of your life as you would an office built with an erector set. Add a
      building block for my job search, another for Mom's 80th Birthday, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      So, how do you build something meaningful, whether it's as simple as a
      recipe or as complex as an order form, with a date and rows and columns?
      Simply connect the blocks together into lists, tables, columns, rows,
      forms, web pages. What would to take a geek a week is now easy for anyone
      in seconds. That is the Toy Office breakthrough!
    </li>
  </ul>

      Start by clicking the All button for an list of any publicly available
      toy office suites.  Watch it appear at the top of the list as Untitled,
      with your name. Click on it, change its name and choose the list view.
      It's the easiest. The list view lets you add a list to your office suite.
      You can get 80% of the benefit with just the list view and it only takes
      minutes to learn. You get a instant web site, a place to share info and
      pick up comments, a common ground to work together on stuff, a place to
      post your resum√© for higher visibility. And your own office in the toy
      office cloud building. With your own web address like
      toyoffice.net/suite/9003 (coming soon).
