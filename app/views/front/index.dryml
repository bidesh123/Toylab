    Here is where Toy Office comes in.
    With Toy Office, you can construct and then manage the different areas of
    your life as you would an office built with an erector set. Add a building
    block for my job search, another for Mom's 80th Birthday, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, how do you build something meaningful, whether it's as simple as a
    recipe or as complex as ? Simply connect the blocks together, into lists,
    tables, columns, rows, forms, web pages. What used to take a geek a week is
    now easy for anyone in seconds. That is the Toy Office breakthrough!

    to or a brand new Toy Office. It will appear as card #something. Click on
    it, change its name and choose the list view. It's the easiest. The list
    view lets you add items. You can add items to anything, even other items.
    You can get 80% of the benefit with just the list view and it only takes
    minutes to learn. You get a instant web site, a place to share info and
    pick up comments, a common ground to work together on stuff, a place to
    post your resum√© for higher visibility. And your own office in the toy
    office cloud building. With your own web address like toyoffice.net/suite/9003 (coming soon).
